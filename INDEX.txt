  >> String in JS :- JavaScript strings are used for storing and manipulating 
  text. A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.
   You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes 
   surrounding the string: To find the length of a string, use the built-in 
   length property

    The String object lets you work with a series of characters; it wraps JavaScript’s string 
primitive data type with a number of helper methods.
As JavaScript automatically converts between string primitives and String objects, you can 
call any of the helper methods of the String object on a string primitive.
Use the following syntax to create a String object.
var val = new String(string);
The string parameter is a series of characters that has been properly encoded.
