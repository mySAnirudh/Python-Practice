JavaScript supports extending data types. JavaScript objects are a great way to define 
custom data types.
An object is an instance which contains a set of key value pairs. Unlike primitive data 
types, objects can represent multiple or complex values and can change over their life 
time. The values can be scalar values or functions or even array of other objects.
The syntactic variations for defining an object is discussed further.
