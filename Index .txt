The padding property allows you to specify how much space should appear 
between the content of an element and its border:
The value of this attribute should be either a length, a percentage, or the word 
inherit. If the value is inherit, it will have the same padding as its parent 
element. If a percentage is used, the percentage is of the containing box.
The following CSS properties can be used to control lists. You can also set 
different values for the padding on each side of the box using the following 
properties:
 The padding-bottom specifies the bottom padding of an element.
 The padding-top specifies the top padding of an element.
 The padding-left specifies the left padding of an element.
 The padding-right specifies the right padding of an element.
 The padding serves as shorthand for the preceding properties.
