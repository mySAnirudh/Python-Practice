Colors are very important to give a good look and feel to your website. You can specify 
colors on page level using <body> tag or you can set colors for individual tags 
using bgcolor attribute.
The <body> tag has following attributes which can be used to set different colors:
 bgcolor - sets a color for the background of the page.
 text - sets a color for the body text.
 alink - sets a color for active links or selected links.
 link - sets a color for linked text.
 vlink - sets a color for visited links - that is, for linked text that you have 
already clicked on.
HTML Color Coding Methods
There are following three different methods to set colors in your web page:
 Color names - You can specify color names directly like green, blue or red.
 Hex codes - A six-digit code representing the amount of red, green, and blue 
that makes up the color.
 Color decimal or percentage values - This value is specified using the rgb() 
property.
Now we will see these coloring schemes one by one.
