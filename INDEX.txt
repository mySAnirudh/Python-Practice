    You can use JavaScript to create a complex animation having, but not limited to, the 
following elements: 
 Fireworks 
 Fade effect 
 Roll-in or Roll-out 
 Page-in or Page-out 
 Object movements 
In this chapter, we will see how to use JavaScript to create an animation. 
JavaScript can be used to move a number of DOM elements (<img />, <div>, or any other 
HTML element) around the page according to some sort of pattern determined by a logical 
equation or function. 
JavaScript provides the following functions to be frequently used in animation programs. 
 setTimeout (function, duration) - This function calls the function after duration 
milliseconds from now. 
 setInterval (function, duration) - This function calls the function after every 
duration milliseconds.
 clearTimeout (setTimeout_variable) - This function clears any timer set by the 
setTimeout() function. 
JavaScript can also set a number of attributes of a DOM object including its position on 
the screen. You can set the top and the left attribute of an object to position it anywhere 
on the screen. Following is the syntax for the same.
// Set distance from left edge of the screen. 
object.style.left = distance in pixels or points; 
or
// Set distance from top edge of the screen. 
object.style.top = distance in pixels or points;
