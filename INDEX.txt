    Redirect is a way to send both users and search engines to a different URL from the one 
they originally requested. Page redirection is a way to automatically redirect a web page 
to another web page. The redirected page is often on the same website, or it can be on a 
different website or a web server.
JavaScript Page Redirection
window.location and window.location.href
In JavaScript, you can use many methods to redirect a web page to another one. Almost 
all methods are related to window.location object, which is a property of the Window 
object. It can be used to get the current URL address (web address) and to redirect the 
browser to a new page. Both usages are same in terms of behavior. window.location
returns an object. If .href is not set, window.location defaults to change the parameter 
.href.



  assign() vs. replace()
The difference between assign() and replace() method is that the location.replace() 
method deletes the current URL from the document history, so it is unable to navigate 
back to the original document. You can't use the browsers "Back" button in this case. If 
you want to avoid this situation, you should use location.assign() method, because it loads
a new Document in the browser.
location.reload()
The location.reload() method reloads the current document in the browser window.
Following is the syntax for the same.
window.location.reload("http://www.yahoo.com");
window.navigate()
The window.navigate() method is similar to assigning a new value to the 
window.location.href property. Because it is only available in MS Internet Explorer, so you 
should avoid using this in cross-browser development.
Following is the syntax for the same.
window.navigate("http://www.abc.com");


 Redirection and Search EngineOptimization
If you want to notify the search engines (SEO) about your URL forwarding, you should add 
the rel="canonical" meta tag to your website head part because search engines don't 
analyze JavaScript to check the redirection.
Following is the syntax for the same.
<link rel="canonical" href="http://abc.com/" />
