 The cursor property of CSS allows you to specify the type of cursor that should 
be displayed to the user.
One good usage of this property is in using images for submit buttons on forms. 
By default, when a cursor hovers over a link, the cursor changes from a pointer 
to a hand. However, it does not change form for a submit button on a form. 
Therefore, whenever someone hovers over an image that is a submit button, it 
provides a visual clue that the image is clickable. 
The following table shows the possible values for the cursor property:
Value Description
auto Shape of the cursor depends on the context area it is over. For 
example, an ‘I’ over text, a ‘hand’ over a link, and so on.
crosshair A crosshair or plus sign.
default An arrow.
pointer A pointing hand (in IE 4 this value is hand).
move The ‘I’ bar.
